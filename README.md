# About Me

Hi! I'm Ryosuke Iwahashi (a.k.a Iwancof) enrolled in the University of Tsukuba.

I have a deep interest in low-level development and low-level security. Apart from this, I am deeply curious about various fields of engineering, mathematics, and the natural sciences.

I have organized and participated in several security events known as Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions, where I've won prizes at SECCON, one of the biggest CTF events in Japan. I've also had the opportunity to write papers on circuit-level security, further cultivating my expertise in this domain.

I often use Rust in my development work, contributing several libraries to crates.io, and developing tools for binary optimization.
In addition to Rust, I am proficient in multiple programming languages, including C/C++, C#, Python, and TypeScript. I also have the skill to write assembly code for x86_64 architecture and have previously embarked on a project developing an operating system solely with assembly code.

Thank you for your time and I look forward to potentially collaborating in the future.
