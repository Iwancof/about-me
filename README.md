# About Me

Hi there!
I'm Iwancof! 

I'm 19 years old, and belong to Kosen.  I will be going to Tsukuba University next year.
My main interest is Security, Development, and all of Science.

I play and organize CTFs and write some papers. low-level offensive security is Wonderful in particular. (I love pwn challenge)

I love Rust lang for development.
I published some libraries to crates.io and created a tool for programming contests (e.g. AtCoder).
Of course, I can use any other major languages(C/C++, Assembly, Python, TypeScript, ...)

Apart from computers, I like pure mathematics and electromagnetism. I used Hilbert Space for kernel multivariate analysis in my old research. and now, use electromagnetism for transistor security.
